## Project Description
The theme of the game is a mild dark and psychological horror with some occasional creative
tints of comedy and silliness. For comparison, the theme can be closely compared to the board
game Betrayal at House on the Hill.

From the perspective of the end user (the player), our game objective is to instill a bit of
suspense and excitement in the player and to motivate them to interact with the features in each
room as they are driven by the story goal. The user will find that they are able to gain clues and
information as they interact with room features and objects. In order to perform this, the user
can interact with the game using a mixture of pre-defined verbs and nouns describing the
features, objects, and directions within the room.

Using our thoroughly written and descriptive text, the user should be able to use their
imagination to envision the adventure that the words describe. Certain features in the room are
printed in a different text color to serve as a hint for the player.

There are 15 rooms in the haunted house, and each room has two “features” to be examined
and interacted with by the player. When the player enters a room for the first time, the game will
print a long-form description of the room, including directions you can go and what features
there are to interact with. Throughout the house there are also 8 objects that the player can
acquire and place into their inventory.

The user interacts with the environment though text input, using verb that are predefined, such
as look, take, eat and climb. There is a help function that can be called to display what verbs
can be used, or at least tried.

At any time the user can save the game or load a valid game file.
