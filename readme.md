Strangely, a fog seems to be drifting down from the top of the stairsBehind you, the back door to the garden shows the path leading out. There is still time to go back. You have the sense that you could leave and the house would forgive you. There is a dark hallway to your left. You can't see a thing. There is another dark hallway to your right. You hear faint music that seems to be coming from there..  You see: 
The chandelair beings to flicker; the wind you've been sensing seems to pick up. Suddenly the room goes completely dark and ALEX only has time to gasp before you feel suddenly like you are being watched. The light turn back on. 'What the hell was that' you say, turning to look at ALEX. But ALEX is gone.
 You have to find ALEX.

TO DO:
add "event" structure to room class

# Object Text within Room Descriptions
Object text is added in the Game class via the `add_object_text()` function after the object is set to be in that particular room via `set_has_object()`. The above are done within the `init_rooms()` class, which also sets each individual room within a room array, so that it is easy to refer to via index. The Game class also houses the objects, which are referred to within the Room classes by their index, which is also set within the room class by id.
