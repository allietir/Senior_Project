## Live to-do list for bug and feature tracking
This document was created to help us informally track low to medium priority bugs, features, or code change requests.

- Bug: In Room1 (garden) the player can climb the tree (feature2) and interact with the gravestone (feature1) to grab the knife (object 5) before climbing down.
- Normalize "Entranceway" to "Entrance" or "Foyer" or "Entryway"
- Data structure needed to save gamestate such as object locations, player locations, whether a room has been entered before, etc.
