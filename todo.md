## Live to-do list for bug and feature tracking
This document was created to help us informally track low to medium priority bugs, features, or code change requests.

- In Room1 (garden) the player can climb the tree (feature2) and interact with the gravestone (feature1) to grab the knife (object 5) before climbing down.

- For Room1 (garden), event_one() should be tied to the object (dagger) so that this description will replay if the player drops the dagger in another room and picks it up again.
