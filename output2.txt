Strangely, a fog seems to be drifting down from the top of the stairsBehind you, the back door to the garden shows the path leading out. There is still time to go back. You have the sense that you could leave and the house would forgive you. There is a dark hallway to your left. You can't see a thing. There is another dark hallway to your right. You hear faint music that seems to be coming from there..  You see: There is a paiting of a stern looking family on the wall. Their features are blurred but they are dressed in old fashioned clothing and are unsmiling. There's a tall, darkly hansome man with what you swear is a bloodthirsty look in his eye. There's a meek looking woman who seems to be staring, not at the artist but at her hands. And there is a little girl clutching what looks like a doll, but you can't see much more. and At the entranceway of the foyer there is table. On top of the table is a little music box.and

Hello? Do you need help?
------PLAYER listen() Faceless Man------
You hear a voice, as if inside your head. 'I need my face. Find my face. Help me see' 

------PLAYER speak() Faceless Man------
Your face? Where can I help you find your face? How did you lose it? I have so many questions.

------PLAYER listen() Faceless Man------
 'There's a ring on the table. Place the ring on my finger and I will be able to see.' 
You consider the situation. You can help the monster find his face and he may attack you once he has power. You simply do now know what the right thing to do is in this situation.
 The creature seems to sense your hesitance. You hear his voice in your head. 'I know where your friend is. The one that came with you. I can tell you where they are. But I cannot see without my eyes. Please. Find the ring that will give me back my face, and I will tell you where to find your friend.
 You decide to locate the ring.
------PLAYER push() table-----
You try to push the table, but it is much too heavy. However, it seems to upset some of the items on the table slightly, and you catch a glint of a ring on the center of the table. You consider taking the ring and giving it to the creauture, but that seems foolish. If you push the table agian, you may be able to get the ring to jostle to the the front of the monster.
------PLAYER pull() table-----
The ring jostles back to its original position. Oops.

------PLAYER push() table AGAIN-----
You push the table again, and this seems to justle the ring towards the monster. The monster clutches at the ring. You wait in terror.
The create places the ring on his hand and his skin begins to melt off, leaving a disgusting puddle on the floor. However, in his place is a small, elf like creature. ' Thank you for freeing me' says the small creature. 'I will keep my promise. Your friend is below ground. I can sense them.'
 The creature then scurries out before you can say anything else.
 What does it mean, that your friend is below ground? Are they alive?
